- Retain 100% equity

**VC Funding Scenario** (If aggressive growth desired):
- **Seed Round**: $1.5M (12-18 months runway)
  - Use: Hire 3 engineers, 2 marketers, 1 designer
  - Goal: $1M ARR, 5,000 paid users
  - Valuation: $5M pre-money (30% dilution)
- **Series A**: $8M (24 months runway)
  - Use: Enterprise sales team, international expansion

## Risks & Mitigation

### Market Risks

**Risk 1: Slow VR/AR Adoption**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (reduces TAM by 50%)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on web UI first (proven demand)
  - AR works on existing phones (no headset needed)
  - WebXR VR works on Quest browser (no app install)
  - Fallback: 3D web visualization is still valuable

**Risk 2: Competitor Copies Features**
- **Likelihood**: High (especially DJI)
- **Impact**: Medium (competition for customers)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Build brand loyalty early
  - Hardware-agnostic (works with any drone, DJI is lock-in)
  - Community features (network effects)
  - Fast iteration (stay ahead)
  - Patents on AR/VR methods

**Risk 3: Drone Regulations Tighten**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (reduces use cases)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Compliance features (help users follow rules)
  - Work with FAA on standards
  - Expand internationally (diversify regulatory risk)
  - Pivot to training/simulation if needed

---

### Technical Risks

**Risk 4: GPS Accuracy Issues**
- **Likelihood**: High (inherent limitation)
- **Impact**: Medium (AR overlay inaccurate)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Kalman filtering (smooth GPS jitter)
  - Sensor fusion (GPS + IMU + compass)
  - Visual odometry (use phone camera)
  - Set user expectations (±5m accuracy)

**Risk 5: Performance (Phone overheating, VR stuttering)**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (poor UX = churn)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Extensive optimization (60 FPS target)
  - Adaptive quality settings
  - Support mid-range devices (not just flagship)
  - Battery saver mode

**Risk 6: Backend Scaling**
- **Likelihood**: Low (proven tech stack)
- **Impact**: High (downtime = churn)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Horizontal scaling (FastAPI + Redis)
  - CDN for video streams
  - Load testing before launch
  - Monitoring (Datadog, PagerDuty)

---

### Business Risks

**Risk 7: High Churn**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (consumer SaaS is fickle)
- **Impact**: High (kills growth)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Onboarding excellence (reduce time-to-value)
  - Regular feature releases (stay fresh)
  - Customer success team (proactive support)
  - Annual plans (reduce monthly churn)
  - Usage alerts (re-engage inactive users)

**Risk 8: CAC Too High**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (paid ads are expensive)
- **Impact**: High (unit economics break)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on organic (SEO, ASO, content)
  - Referral program (viral growth)
  - Influencer marketing (cheaper than ads)
  - Product-led growth (free tier → paid)

**Risk 9: Enterprise Sales Cycle Too Long**
- **Likelihood**: High (6-12 month cycles)
- **Impact**: Medium (cash flow issues)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with SMBs (shorter cycles)
  - Annual prepay discounts (cash upfront)
  - Focus on SaaS revenue first (predictable)
  - Only hire sales team when ready

---

### Legal & Compliance Risks

**Risk 10: Privacy Concerns (Video streaming)**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (lawsuits, regulation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Encryption (end-to-end for video)
  - Privacy policy (GDPR, CCPA compliant)
  - User consent flows
  - Data retention limits (auto-delete old videos)

**Risk 11: Patent Trolls**
- **Likelihood**: Low (but costly if happens)
- **Impact**: Medium (legal fees)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Defensive patent filing
  - Join patent pools (OIN)
  - Insurance (IP litigation coverage)
